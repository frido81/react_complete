# 129 Module Introduction & Starting Project

-   Not need in all apps, advanced buy simplify and sometimes needed
-   Accessing DOM elements to Refs
-   Manage values with refs that shouldn't be state
-   Exposing API functions from components
-   Detaching DOM rendering from JSX structure with Portals

# 130 Repetition: Managing User Input with State (Two-Way-Binding)

# 131 Repetition: Fragments

# 132 Introducing Refs: Connecting & Accessing HTML Elements via Refs

# 133 Manipulating the DOM via Refs

# 134 Refs vs State Values

## refs:

-   Whenever a ref changes, component does not re-render
-   Can be used to gain direct DOM element access

## state

-   Whenever a state changes, component does re-render
-   should be used for values that are directly reflected in the UI
-   Should not be used for "behind the scenes" values that have no
    direct UI impact.
